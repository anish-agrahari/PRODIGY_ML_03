Cat vs Dog Classifier 🐱🐶

Welcome to the Cat vs Dog Classifier! This project is designed to distinguish between images of cats and dogs using deep learning. Whether you're a pet lover or just diving into AI and machine learning, this project is a great hands-on experience.

🚀 Project Overview

This is a deep learning model built using Python and Jupyter Notebook, leveraging TensorFlow/Keras to classify images of cats and dogs. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images and learns to recognize features that distinguish these adorable animals.

📂 Project Structure

CAT_DOG_predict.ipynb - The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code for training and testing the model.

Dataset - A collection of cat and dog images used for training and validation (not included in this repository, but can be downloaded separately).

Model Checkpoints - Saved models and weights (if applicable) to resume training or perform inference.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 🐍

TensorFlow/Keras 🧠

OpenCV (for image preprocessing) 📷

NumPy & Pandas (for data handling) 📊

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization) 📈

🔧 How to Use

Set up the environment – Install required libraries using:

pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib opencv-python

Run the Jupyter Notebook – Open and execute CAT_DOG_predict.ipynb.

Train the model – Upload the dataset and let the model learn!

Test with new images – Provide custom images to see if the model classifies them correctly.

📌 Key Features

✅ Image Preprocessing for better model accuracy✅ Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction✅ Performance evaluation with accuracy and loss graphs✅ Test the model with your own pet images!

💡 Future Improvements

🔹 Enhance the model with data augmentation🔹 Optimize for faster and more accurate predictions🔹 Deploy as a web app for easier use
